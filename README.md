# Port-Scan-O-matic

### Python Based Port Scanner 
- Scans for open ports on your system
- Give system information such as OS version and Hostname/IP, MAC address, etc. 
> This is just a basic port scanning application that will also give you information about the system you are on in addition to open ports maybe some music will be added in the background when using it. 

>I Have also included a link to another project Grephenex that helps you to harden your system (https://github.com/grapheneX/grapheneX)
